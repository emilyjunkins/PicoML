#with kaiju, I was able to take each translated gene's taxonomic assignment and pull out just chlorophyta. I will use these contigs to reassemble in Canu
#I can now go back into the PB.contigs.fasta file since I know which contigs belong to chlorophyta and pull them out
#I need to go back in and pull the reads that only have to to with the contig I need. There is a file from Canu (a layout file that associated each read ID with a tig ID)
#.layout folder that gives the read ID in each contig, however these are post correction reads
#you need to get the original raw IDs from the gpkStore folders in trimming and untigging readNames.txt
#this was a NIGHTMARE. From the contigs.layout.readToTig file it took the first two colums that contain the read ID and the associated tig. These are not numbered sequentially for future referece. The contig ID in the contig.fasta file is the same at the tig ID associated with the read ID.
awk '{print $1,$2}' PBpico.contigs.layout.readToTig > readswithcontigs.layout

#I then took that two column file with e read IDs and contig and while parsing through the chloraphyta contigs, I could awk out the read IDS I wanted
while read line
do 
awk '$2 == '$line' {print $0}' readswithcontigs.layout  
done < chlorophyta.contigs.txt > chlorophytareadIDs.txt

cat chlorophytareadIDs.txt | awk '{print $1}' > justreadIDslist.txt

#pull out sequnce name associated with that canu-given readID (this will take a while)
while read line
do
awk '$1 == '$line' {print $0}' readNames.txt
done < justreadIDslist.txt > sequencenamesofcholorphytareads.txt

# Now we need to go into the PacBio raw reads and pull out those that correspond to the new list
cat *.fastq > allreads.fastq

# i need to make a new file with just the read names
awk '{print $2}' sequencenamesofchlorophytareads.txt > rawseqname.txt

#use QIIME filter_fasta.py to get reads that mapped to chlorophyta contigs
